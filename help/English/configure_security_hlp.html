    <h2>KCS Policy Control Mode</h2>
    <p>The KCS Policy Control Mode allows an administrator to control access to the BMC over the Keyboard Controller
        Style (KCS) interface. The KCS interface is a communications channel used by the server host (UEFI, Operating
        System) to communicate with the server BMC. Although the KCS interface is protected by Ring 0 access, it is
        unauthenticated and considered insecure for some deployment models. KCS Policy Control Mode restrict commands
        defined by the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) specification sent over the KCS interface after
        core BIOS functions have completed. Choices from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>KCS Policy Control Mode - Provisioning</li>
        <p>This configuration setting is intended for normal IPMI compliant communications between the Host OS and the
            BMC. This mode should be used when provisioning the BMC configuration for deployment.</p>
        <li>KCS Policy Control Mode - Provisioned Host Disabled</li>
        <p>This configuration setting disables the IPMI KCS command interfaces between the Host OS and the BMC. This is
            a non-compliant IPMI configuration that will impact the operation of the Server Management Software running
            on the Host OS. This only applies to the IPMI commands over the KCS interfaces, and does not apply to the
            authenticated network interfaces to the BMC.</p>
        <li>KCS Policy Control Mode - Provisioned Host Allowlist</li>
        <p>This configuration setting enables the use of an Access Control List by the BMC Firmware that allows
            applications executing on the host OS to have access to a limited set of IPMI commands using the KCS
            interfaces. This is a non-compliant IPMI configuration that may impact the operation of the Server
            Management Software running on the Host OS. For example, the IPMI commands that are used to provision the
            BMC configuration settings, or control the state of the Host OS, will be disallowed when the BMC KCS
            interface is in restricted mode. This only applies to the IPMI commands over the KCS interfaces, and does
            not apply to the authenticated network interfaces to the BMC.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Host Interface</h2>
    <p>Enable/Disable Host interface for eth2.</p>
    <h2>Failed Login Attempts</h2>
    <p>Input the Failed Login Attempts times.
        Set the number of failed login attempts a user is allowed before being locked out. Zero means no lockout. Failed
        Login Attempts should be between 0 and 255. Default is 3 attempts.
    </p>

    <h2>User Lockout Time (sec)</h2>
    <p>Set the time in seconds that the user is locked out before being allowed to login again. Zero means User Lockout
        Time is disabled. If a user was automatically disabled due to the Bad Password threshold, the user will remain
        disabled until re-enabled via the Set User Access command. User Lockout Time should be between 0 and 65535.
        Default is 60sec.</p>

    <h2>Port Settings</h2>
    <p>
    <h2>HTTPS (Secure) Port</h2>
    <p>Set the port used for https (default: 443) web sessions. Changing this setting will immediately terminate all
        current web sessions.</p>
    <h2>SOL SSH Port</h2>
    <p>Set the port used for SOL SSH sessions.</p>
    <h2>Password Rules - Complexity</h2>
    <p>Select the Password Complexity dropdown to set the password complexity (Low, Medium, High). </p>
    <p>Password cannot exceed 20 bytes of length due to IPMI 2.0 restrictions.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Low</b></dt>
        <dd>-Passwords can be formed with the characters a-zA-Z0-9_ including punctuation</dd>
        <dd>-Password length should not be shorter than 8 characters</dd>
        <dd>-pam_cracklib is used to strength check the password before accepting it. Passwords must not confirm to dictionary words,
            palindrome and so on.</dd>
    </dl>

            allowed)
        </dd>
        <dd>-Could not contains continuous alphabets longer than 3 characters (e.g. (AbC)3478!, 57$(DeF)68k are not

        <dd>-Contains no more than 3 same alphabets(case insensitive) (e.g. Fkr4fcpF&f (4 'f' or 'F'), Glg5gt2G! (4 'g' or 'G') are not allowed)</dd>
        <dd>-For symbols, use the ASCII code instead. The combination of alphabets/digits/symbols in continuous ASCII code could not be longer than or equal to 3 characters (e.g., below are not allowed)
            <br /> &nbsp; #$%, ASCII 35, 36, 37 <- symbols
            <br /> &nbsp; 9:;, ASCII 57, 58, 59 <- digits + symbols
            <br /> &nbsp; YZ[, ASCII 89, 90, 91 <- alphabets + symbols</dd>
