            <p>The Event Log displays all <i>System Event Log</i> records captured by the BMC.</p>
            <p>Each SEL record is tagged with an Event ID, Timestamp, Sensor Name, Controller, Severity, Sensor Type and Description field.</p>
            <p>The Event Log displays all records present by default. The number of records displayed in one page can be controlled. It is recommended the number of records per page be kept to a minimum to keep page load times small. The event records may be filtered by the <i>source</i> of the event, as well as the <i>severity</i> of the event.</p>

                    <li>Critical
                </ul>
            <h2>Total Event Log</h2>
